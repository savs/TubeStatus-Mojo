Tube Status
===========

This app allows you to instantly see the current status of all London Underground tube lines and DLR. Colour-coded by line, this app shows current alerts identifying any problems with each line.

More information about the app can be found on the <a href="http://www.andrewsavory.com/tubestatus/">app home page</a> and in the <a href="https://developer.palm.com/appredirect/index.php?packageid=com.andrewsavory.tubestatus">Palm App Catalog</a>.

This was my first Mojo app.

This app uses the free <a href="http://tubeupdates.com/">Tube Updates API</a>.

The Tube Status idea provides a basis for quickly determining how easy it is to write "webby" apps for a given platform.
